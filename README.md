##School District Analysis 

In the initial school district analysis we examine student performance in both reading and math standardized test and compared the schools against each other. We compared school budget, type  of school and budget per student and academic scores  in order to get a full picture of the school district performance in each school.

Following allegations of a data breach that gave an unfair advantage to 9th graders in Thomas School we manipulated data to remove the scores of their scores without taking the rest of the scores out. 

##Results 

Stripping the data of the 9th graders in Thomas High School did not skewed the data heavily and most of the other results of other 9th graders and of Thomas High school remain along similar parameters as others schools. 

The mean was the most significant change in our data, as we decrease the count of scores and students of Thomas High School might have had a significant change. Nonetheless having examing the data this might not have as big of an impact as one might have had thought.
